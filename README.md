# MapSideMerge-Join
We provide an adaption of the classical sort-merge join for MapReduce, which we introduce as an optimization for our RDFPath MapReduce Processor.


More information, the source files and pre-compiled binaries are published on our project website which is hosted by the University of Freiburg:
